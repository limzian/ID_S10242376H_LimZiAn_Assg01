# IDAssignment1

This is my website for my ASG1 for my ID.

This website is based from a fictional Internet Cafe called "Dolphin Cyber Cafe", which is a service that functions as a place to rent computers as well as a cafe.

This Internet Cafe is based on real life internet cafes. In reality, Internet cafes are very hard to find in Singapore, so I wanted to make a fictional website about them.

## Design Process

I designed this Internet Cafe with students as the primary focus.

As a result, I came up with this User Story which was my design focus:

As a student, I want to have cheap and easy access to computers so I can play games without paying a lot for a personal computer.

## Features

### Existing Features

My Website has three pages, being the Home Page, the About Us page and the Contact Us page.

The Home page contains brief information about the about us page and the contact us page, and contains links to each of the sections respectively.

- By having the home page display the brief information about the other pages, the user can know what to expect for the other webpages and navigate the website easier.

The About Us page contains more detailed information about the Internet Cafe and it's history.

- By having the About Us page explain more about the internet cafe, the user can know what computer and games are avaliable before entering the cybercafe physically.

The Contact Us page contains a contact us form, as well as a map which shows the location of the cybercafe nearest to you.

- There are also social media links to help the user contact them through alternative methods.
- The contact us form helps the website owner easily get feedback about his cafe and website.
- The map helps the user locate the cybercafe easily.

### Features Left to Implement

- More webpages for more detail about explaining the cafe.
- More Interactive elements in the website to make it more appealing to users.

### Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this project from a cyber cafe located at Junction 10 that had shut down due to Covid-19 during the pandemic, so I wanted to make a similar website for them.
